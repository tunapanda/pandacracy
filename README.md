# Welcome

Hi there! Welcome to the Pandacracy Guidebook. The Guidebook will help guide you on your journey to manifesting your best self while engaging in lifelong learning, earning, and problems solving.

This is an evolving Guidebook to maintaining the energy and focus of self-managing teams and organizations. Since teams are made up of individuals, we place a strong focus on each individual's journey. 

One of our Core Values is **respect for individuals**. Part of this is to help push humanity forward past the practice of grouping/stereotyping people based on certain traits -- whether that be gender, tribe, nationality, skin tone, etc. "Don't judge a book by it's cover," as they say. We recognize each person's strength and capacity to contribute to better communities, and apply a growth mindset to developing that strength and capacity every day. Another part of this is to recognize that each of us is different, and that's awesome. There's no evidence that Einstein said: 

>"Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid." - Probably Not Albert Einstein 

But it's a great quote anyway.

This Pandacracy Guidebook is based on the personal experience of growing our team from 2 people to more than 30 between 2014 and 2017 and making a lot of big mistakes along the way. During that time we also had a lot of successes, graduating over 200 young people from our intensive tech, design, and business training courses and opening 2 full-time training facilities in both urban and rural parts of Kenya. We draw on a wealth of knowledge by thinkers such as Carol Dweck, Frederic Laloux, Wangari Maathai, Lex Sisney, and many more. Awesome things can happen if we 1) properly align the team's Purpose with the Purpose of the individual, while 2) organizing and energizing our projects and processes properly. WARNING: manifesting awesomeness is not easy, it requires a great deal of energy and focus.

This Guidebook has been specifically designed for Tunapanda Institute, a training and digital services organization based in Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya. It is published under a Creative Commons (BY-SA) License, so do with it as you wish. Our Purpose was redefined in May 2017 as the following:

> Tunapanda Institute trains young people in tech, design, and business skills so we become lifelong learners, earners, and problem solvers.

We have not yet defined "young people" -- but suffice it to say that with enough creativity and curiosity, you can be 100 years **young**.

## Core values

Values are an important part of helping people develop in the context of a team. They help people figure out what to do and how to do it without being told what to do or how to do it.

**Responsibility**. Operating openly and transparently to each other and the world.

**Collaboration**. Working together to transcend boundaries.

**Innovation**. Creating value through continuous innovation.

**Respect**. Respecting each person as an individual.

**Growth mindset**. Always learning. Always teaching. Together.

The importance of combining Values with Purpose cannot be overstated. It's worth reading a bit from Laloux's Reinventing Organizations [wiki on Culture and Values](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Culture_and_Values).

# Pandacracy: Upgrade your management operating system 
Pandacracy is an emerging flexible, light-weight, and portable "management operating system" that can help your team grow to the next level while encouraging people to bring their full selves to work, share their ideas, and innovate in line with your team or organization's Purpose.

Think of adopting pandacracy like upgrading your computer from an outdated system like MS-DOS to a modern, open, powerful, flexible operating sytem like Linux or Android. 

Linux is the open source operating system that powers more than 95% of the world's supercomputers, most of the internet, and even most mobile phones (through Android).

This is an explanation of management processes and tools that are used by [Tunapanda Institute](www.tunapanda.org) to achieve a wide range of goals with a relatively inexperienced, but extremely high-potential, team of young people from around Kenya and the world.

Pandacracy is a "[holacracy](http://www.holacracy.org/how-it-works/)-like" open management operating system. Like other similar systems, much of our work is based on other systems like Agile development. Unlike other similar systems, all the supporting software and tools we create are open source and designed not only for highly-experience top professionals to work better - but also for young and inexperienced people to become top professionals.

# Overview
Pandacracy is currently (05/2016) used by only two organizations: Tunapanda Institute and Tunapanda Institute Kibera CBO.

Tunapanda Institute is a small but relatively complex ("full stack") non-profit - but revenue-generating - group that aims first to understand the world and second to spread access to high-quality learning experiences. Our current focus is on enabling young people in East Africa to develop skills related to problem solving and value creation in technology, design, and business.

# Core Purpose and Primary Functions

We see 3 primary functions of our team:

1. **Teaching and learning.** This is who we are. We run a training facility in the outskirts of Kibera, a large Nairobi informal settlement. Training and school operations are now largely performed by graduates of our 3-month basic training program and the 25 young people who are accepted into a cohort pay no fees and even receive a small stipend to take part.
2. **Producing and distributing.** This is how we send [energy](http://organizationalphysics.com/2012/02/20/the-universal-success-formula/) out into the world. We buid open source software and create open learning resources that digitize and extend our core training so that other individuals, groups, and organizations can copy our model and help improve on it.
3. **Selling and earning.** This brings energy in so we can keep being who we are. We perform services for clients and (try to) convince people to support what we're doing. In order to maintain our reputation we have to execute well on work for clients by performing work creating curricula, digitizing materials, building software, peforming research using human centered design (HCD) methodologies, and consulting for others who wish to copy/modify our model.

In order to accomplish this we divide our organization into various circles, which operate semi-autonomously, some of which are connected through "strategic grouping."

Soon we'll draw a diagram, but for now look at it this way:

### An Incomplete Map of the Earth Circles

* Earth (planet: super-circle of the continents)
 * Africa (continent: sub-circle of Earth + super-circle of Nairobi, Mombasa, Cairo, etc)
  * Nairobi (city: sub-circle of Africa + super-circle of Kibera)
   * Kibera (the creative center of the universe)
   * Dandora (wishes it were as creative as Kibera)
  * Mombasa (city: sub-circle of Africa)
  * Cairo (city: sub-circle of Africa)
 * The Americas (continent: sub-circle of Earth + super-circle of Rio de Janeiro, New York, Mexico City, etc)
  * Rio de Janeiro (city: sub-circle of The Americas)
  * New York (city: sub-circle of The Americas + super-circle of Brooklyn, Wall Street, etc)
   * Brooklyn (Nas)
   * Wall Street (building bridges or walls, it's hard to say)
  * Mexico City (city: sub-circle of The Americas)
 * Jamaica (continent: sub-circle of Earth + super-circle of Kingston)
  * Kingston (city: home of Damian and Bob Marley)

# Energy Points
The assignment of energy points allows peer-to-peer evaluation of roles within a given circle. The points take on meaning when bonus money (usually from work performed for clients) flows through the energy points system.

The process is as follows:
