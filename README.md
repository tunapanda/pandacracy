# Welcome

Hi there! Welcome to the Pandacracy Guidebook. This guide will help you on your journey to manifesting your best self while engaging in lifelong learning, earning, and problems solving.

This is an evolving guidebook to maintaining the energy and focus of self-managing teams and organizations, and draws on a wealth of knowledge by thinkers such as Carol Dweck, Frederic Laloux, Lex Sisney, and more. Since teams are made up of individuals, we place a strong focus on each individual's journey. If we can properly align the Purpose of the team with the Purpose of the individual, and organize our projects and processes properly, magical things can happen. WARNING: making magic is not easy, it requires a great deal of energy and focus.

This Guidebook has been specifically designed for Tunapanda Institute, a training and digital services organization based in Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya. Our Purpose was redefined in May 2017 as the following:

> Tunapanda Institute exists to train young people in tech, design, and business skills so we become lifelong learners, earners, and problem solvers

# Pandacracy: Upgrade your management operating system 
Pandacracy is an emerging flexible, light-weight, and portable "management operating system" that can help your team grow to the next level while encouraging people to bring their full selves to work, share their ideas, and innovate in line with your team or organization's Purpose.

Think of adopting pandacracy like upgrading your computer from an outdated system like MS-DOS to a modern, open, powerful, flexible operating sytem like Linux or Android. 

Linux is the open source operating system that powers more than 95% of the world's supercomputers, most of the internet, and even most mobile phones (through Android).

This is an explanation of management processes and tools that are used by [Tunapanda Institute](www.tunapanda.org) to achieve a wide range of goals with a relatively inexperienced, but extremely high-potential, team of young people from around Kenya and the world.

Pandacracy is a "[holacracy](http://www.holacracy.org/how-it-works/)-like" open management operating system. Like other similar systems, much of our work is based on other systems like Agile development. Unlike other similar systems, all the supporting software and tools we create are open source and designed not only for highly-experience top professionals to work better - but also for young and inexperienced people to become top professionals.

# Overview
Pandacracy is currently (05/2016) used by only two organizations: Tunapanda Institute and Tunapanda Institute Kibera CBO.

Tunapanda Institute is a small but relatively complex ("full stack") non-profit - but revenue-generating - group that aims first to understand the world and second to spread access to high-quality learning experiences. Our current focus is on enabling young people in East Africa to develop skills related to problem solving and value creation in technology, design, and business.

# Core Purpose and Primary Functions

We see 3 primary functions of our team:

1. **Teaching and learning.** This is who we are. We run a training facility in the outskirts of Kibera, a large Nairobi informal settlement. Training and school operations are now largely performed by graduates of our 3-month basic training program and the 25 young people who are accepted into a cohort pay no fees and even receive a small stipend to take part.
2. **Producing and distributing.** This is how we send [energy](http://organizationalphysics.com/2012/02/20/the-universal-success-formula/) out into the world. We buid open source software and create open learning resources that digitize and extend our core training so that other individuals, groups, and organizations can copy our model and help improve on it.
3. **Selling and earning.** This brings energy in so we can keep being who we are. We perform services for clients and (try to) convince people to support what we're doing. In order to maintain our reputation we have to execute well on work for clients by performing work creating curricula, digitizing materials, building software, peforming research using human centered design (HCD) methodologies, and consulting for others who wish to copy/modify our model.

In order to accomplish this we divide our organization into various circles, which operate semi-autonomously, some of which are connected through "strategic grouping."

Soon we'll draw a diagram, but for now look at it this way:

### An Incomplete Map of the Earth Circles

* Earth (planet: super-circle of the continents)
 * Africa (continent: sub-circle of Earth + super-circle of Nairobi, Mombasa, Cairo, etc)
  * Nairobi (city: sub-circle of Africa + super-circle of Kibera)
   * Kibera (the creative center of the universe)
   * Dandora (wishes it were as creative as Kibera)
  * Mombasa (city: sub-circle of Africa)
  * Cairo (city: sub-circle of Africa)
 * The Americas (continent: sub-circle of Earth + super-circle of Rio de Janeiro, New York, Mexico City, etc)
  * Rio de Janeiro (city: sub-circle of The Americas)
  * New York (city: sub-circle of The Americas + super-circle of Brooklyn, Wall Street, etc)
   * Brooklyn (Nas)
   * Wall Street (building bridges or walls, it's hard to say)
  * Mexico City (city: sub-circle of The Americas)
 * Jamaica (continent: sub-circle of Earth + super-circle of Kingston)
  * Kingston (city: home of Damian and Bob Marley)

# Energy Points
The assignment of energy points allows peer-to-peer evaluation of roles within a given circle. The points take on meaning when bonus money (usually from work performed for clients) flows through the energy points system.

The process is as follows:
