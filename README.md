# Pandacracy: Upgrade your management operating system 
Think of adopting pandacracy like upgrading your computer from an outdated system like MS-DOS to a modern, open, powerful, flexible operating sytem like Linux or Android. 

Linux is the open source operating system that powers more than 95% of the world's supercomputers, most of the internet, and even most mobile phones (through Android).

Pandacracy is an emerging flexible, light-weight, and portable management operating system that can help your team grow to the next level while encouraging people to bring their full selves to work, share their ideas, and innovate in line with your team or organization's purpose.

This is an explanation of management processes and tools that are used by Tunapanda Institute to achieve a wide range of goals with a relatively inexperienced, but extremely high-potential, team of young people from around Kenya and the world.

Pandacracy is a "[holacracy](http://www.holacracy.org/how-it-works/)-like" open management operating system. Like other similar systems, much of our work is based on other systems like Agile development. Unlike other similar systems, all the supporting software and tools we create are open source and designed not only for highly-experience top professionals to work better - but also for young and inexperienced people to become top professionals.

# Overview
Pandacracy is currently (05/2016) used by only two organizations: Tunapanda Institute and Tunapanda Institute Kibera CBO.

Tunapanda Institute is a small but relatively complex ("full stack") non-profit - but revenue-generating - group that aims first to understand the world and second to spread access to high-quality learning experiences. Our current focus is on enabling young people in East Africa to develop skills related to problem solving and value creation in technology, design, and business.

We see 3 primary functions of our team:

1. **Teaching and learning.** We run a training facility in the outskirts of Kibera, a large Nairobi informal settlement. Training and school operations are now largely performed by graduates of our 3-month basic training program and the 25 young people who are accepted into a cohort pay no fees and even receive a small stipend to take part.



# Energy Points
The assignment of energy points allows peer-to-peer evaluation of roles within a given circle. The points take on meaning when bonus money (usually from work performed for clients) flows through the energy points system.

The process is as follows:
